SiTEUP aims to be a customized information system for the 
_Tuna de Engenharia da UP_, a portuguese student music group.

Beyond member management, it provides event and member availability
management to ease up the whole member tracking process.

It also provides some social tools to connect with fans and 
let them know of future events and such.

It is a project still on its infancy.
